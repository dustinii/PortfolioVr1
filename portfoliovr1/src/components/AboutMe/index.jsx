            <p className="about-me__bio">
                I am a full-stack software developer equipped with comprehensive training from the University of
                California, Irvine from my undergrad, and, more recently, at the Full Stack Development
                program with the University of California, Los Angeles. My wide-ranging expertise spans numerous
                languages and technologies, allowing me to proficiently navigate both front-end and back-end
                frameworks.
                I am adept at delivering high-quality and
                efficient code, illustrated through diverse projects that
                I've spearheaded both independently and collaboratively.
                <br></br>
                My passion for building innovative solutions and tackling complex problems fuels my commitment to
                lifelong learning and growth which helps me to adapt
                and deliver in the ever-evolving landscape of Tech.
                I love building things and solving problems! This fuels my desire to contribute as an asset to
                cutting-edge
                projects. I am eager to find opportunities to
                collaborate, innovate, and make meaningful impacts in the dynamic field of technology.
